## Contacts Management Platform

This is a contact management platform that allows users to store and manage contact information, including name, address, email, phone number, and profile picture. The platform also integrates with the Google Places API to allow users to search for addresses when creating or updating a contact.

## Prerequisites for the Challenge

### Platform

The application is developed using Laravel for the backend and Vue.js for the frontend. Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- **PHP** (version 7.4 or higher) with Composer to manage Laravel dependencies.
- **Node.js** (version 12 or higher) with npm to manage Vue.js dependencies.

## Application Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

### 2. Configure the Environment

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and configure the environment variables as needed, especially those related to the database and external services like Google Places API.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Generate the application key:

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

### 3. Prepare the Database

Run the migrations and seeders to prepare the database:

```bash
php artisan migrate --seed
```

This will create the necessary tables and pre-seed the users in the database.

### 4. Start the Application

Start the Laravel development server:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

In a separate terminal, start the Vue.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 5. Configure the Frontend

In the `app.js` file (located in `public/js/app.js`), ensure that state management with Vuex (or Pinia if migrated to Vue 3), form validations with Vee-Validate, and authentication with Laravel Sanctum or JWT are properly configured.

### Application Features

#### 1. **Login**

Allows users to log in to the platform. A registration screen is not necessary as users are pre-seeded in the backend.

#### 2. **Contacts List**

Displays a list of contacts stored by the authenticated user, showing their name and profile photo.

#### 3. **Add New Contact**

Allows the user to add a new contact by specifying an image binary file, name, address, email, and phone number. Uses VeeValidate to validate the form fields.

#### 4. **Update Contact**

Allows the user to update contacts by specifying an image binary file, name, address, email, and phone number. Uses VeeValidate to validate the form fields.

#### 5. **Integration with Google Places API**

Implements the functionality to search for addresses using the Google Places API or another similar service. Allows users to search and select an address intuitively when adding a new contact.

## Challenges Faced

### Nuxt.js Integration

During the development process, I encountered challenges with integrating Nuxt.js due to compatibility issues between Vue 2 and the state management library (Pinia) recommended for use with Vue 3. After exploring multiple solutions, including downgrading dependencies and trying alternative configurations, I decided to focus on delivering a stable and functional application using Vue.js alone.

### Pinia State Management

In an attempt to implement state management using Pinia, I encountered several issues, especially when managing authentication (authStore) and contact management (contactStore). The primary challenge was related to the integration of Pinia with Vue 2 and the handling of state across different components.

Despite these challenges, I attempted to integrate Pinia for state management to manage the authentication process (`authStore`) and contact information (`contactStore`). However, due to these issues, I decided to maintain a simpler state management strategy until the application's core functionality was stabilized.

### Future Improvements

Given more resources, I would:
- Reattempt the integration of Nuxt.js, possibly by upgrading the entire stack to Vue 3 to resolve compatibility issues.
- Further enhance the application's frontend architecture using Nuxt.js for better SSR (Server-Side Rendering).
- Resolve the issues with Pinia state management by upgrading to Vue 3, where Pinia is fully supported and recommended.
- Continue exploring state management solutions to handle complex state interactions effectively in future iterations of the platform.
